# rodash ~ rOpenSci Dashboard

This app was: 

+ built on [Dashing](http://shopify.github.com/dashing), from [Shopify.com](Shopify.com). In their words, "Dashing is a Sinatra based framework that lets you build beautiful dashboards".
+ hosted on Heroku.

See the dashboard here [http://rodash.herokuapp.com/roapi](http://rodash.herokuapp.com/roapi).  One was able to move the tiles (or in their words, widgets) around - put them in new places, etc. Here's a screenshot:
